						</CENTER>

						<p class="big">The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
							Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is an Indian law that aims to guarantee
							the 'right to work' and ensure livelihood security in rural areas
							by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a
							financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer
							to do unskilled manual work. The statute is hailed by the
							government as "the largest and most ambitious social security and
							public works programme in the world". The more comprehensive
							survey of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, a
							‘Supreme Audit Institution’ defined in Article 148 of the
							Constitution of India, reports serious lapses in implementation
							of the act.</p>



						<h3>
							<b>History</b>
						</h3>


						<p class="big">Prior to the enactment of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA,
							India had no program in rural areas that promised employment as
							a legal right, although employment generation through rural works
							had a long history in India dating back to the 1960s. Since
							1960,[n 1] the government had been merging old schemes to
							introduce new ones while retaining the basic objective of
							providing additional wage employment involving unskilled manual
							work, creating ‘durable’ assets, and improving food security in
							rural areas through public works with special safeguards for the
							weaker sections and women of the community. The problem areas had
							also been almost similar like mismanagement, lack of planning and
							implementation. The remuneration had been a combination of wages
							and foodgrains across all schemes. It took 30 years of government
							experimentation to launch major schemes like Jawahar Rozgar
							Yojana (JRY), Employment Assurance Scheme (EAS), Food for Work
							Programme (FWP), Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana (JGSY) and
							Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) that were forerunners to
							Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. In the process, the government
							decentralized implementation by providing financial and
							functional autonomy to the local self-government institutions or
							Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in order to fight corruption.
